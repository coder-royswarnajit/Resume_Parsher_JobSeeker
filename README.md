3656167404		Executive Personal Assistant	"EXECUTIVE PERSONAL ASSISTANT
In this role, youâ€™re the right hand superperson to the Founder and your contribution to their life and business allows them to run their company more effectively and have a bigger impact in the world while finding time to still prioritize their family and personal life. 
At Business of Therapy, we believe that people receive the best care when their therapists are able to live their best lives, with the confidence to show up authentically, free from financial stress and burnout. Business of Therapy offers a wide-range of services to support therapists in starting and growing their own private practices. Current programs include: free webinars and educational content, a membership, self-paced course, business coaching, brand partnerships, and speaking engagement. 
Business of Therapy is a rapidly scaling company, generating $50k+ in sales per month and serving a high number of customers. The Executive Personal Assistant will assist both the Founder and Operations Manager with administrative tasks to help the business run smoothly and efficiently. This is a great flexible work from home opportunity. 
THIS JOB DONE WELL LOOKS LIKE: 
Taking initiative and anticipating needs before theyâ€™re even communicated. 
Never sitting on your hands with a low workload. Recognizing that delegating takes time and effort, so making a conscious effort to seek out tasks and manage your own workload. 
Making sure that things never need to be repeated, i.e. if youâ€™re sent a task, make sure that the work you did is documented, so that if youâ€™re asked to do a task again you will know what will need to be repeated, documented, and assigned. 
Effective and efficient communication: instead of multiple texts, emails, calls and messages throughout the day, questions and updates will be combined (along with all relevant information) for the Founder or Operations Manager to reply to in an easy format. Respecting time and day boundaries, making sure that you ask questions well ahead of time, not leaving things last minute. 
Requiring zero follow-up from the Founder or Operations Manager - if youâ€™re asked to do a task and you know itâ€™s going to take longer than a day or two, make sure the task is added into your task management system and regular updates are given so the team knows that youâ€™re on top of it and doesnâ€™t need to ask.
Having a strong attention to detail, so that the Operations Manager and Founder donâ€™t need to provide Quality Assurance or ask for more information.
Overall, making the Founder's day, weeks and months easier because youâ€™re on top of yours and their workload, you communicate effectively, you donâ€™t add extra tasks to their plate and you are continuously seeking out learning opportunities so you can continue to expand your job role, responsibilities and knowledge.

3744936604	World Spirit of the Game Foundation (SotG Global)	Chairperson	"TIBN is designed as a network of networks, meaning that we don't seek to replace any existing network, simply to provide access to resources which might be beyond the scope of existing networks. The additional scope we provide falls into 3 categories:
Impact focused - While we do provide professional and personal development resources, they are all framed in terms of helping members maximize their positive Impact on the world, not simply business/career success or general happinessGlobally oriented - Spirit of the Game is one of the fastest growing NGOs in the world right now, adding 50-100 volunteer each week, meaning that when you join our network, you gain access to other members and experts all over the world, not just a handful of countriesEmpowerment centric- We don't want our members simply to be students, we also want to empower them to take the skills and mindsets they learn from our experts and pass them on to others
We are looking for City Chairpersons for TIBN United States to join our 10 week Management Training course which will give you step by step directions on getting an Impactful Business community started in your city, complete with training manuals, peer support calls, and a Mentor.

While SpiritoftheGame.org is 4 years old, each of our divisions operate autonomously, so TIBN is essentially start-up which doesn't wish to be beholden to investors who might change their priorities if the economy goes south.So we do need to bring in the revenue before we can start paying you. And since we cannot promise how quickly that will happen, it's best to approach this as a pure volunteer opportunity which ""should"" pay a stipend in the near future or possibly a salary in the long term.If you do not currently have another source of income and/or you are looking to get paid straight away, this is not the position for you.
Estimated time commitment we are looking for while this is a volunteer position is 8-12 hours a week. You will also have considerable discretion if you wish to bring in additional people from your existing professional network for any of our open City Chairpersons positions in other cities or for City Director roles on your own team.
TIBN is a part of the World Spirit of the Game Foundation, an international NGO which was formed to help individuals and organizations take Personal Accountability for maximizing their positive Impact on the world.We're launching the TIBN online community with 4-6 online events each month this winter, and are now starting in-person chapters and Retreats as well.

Required Education

4 Year Degree

ESA is seeking a dynamic and engaging World Language teacher to teach Middle and Upper School Spanish and French. The World Language Department at ESA is structured around the intensive study of French and Spanish. Instruction within the department includes not only the usual skills of reading, writing, and listening, but introduces an entirely new way of speaking. Proper use of intonation, appropriate facial expressions, and gestures inherent to native speakers are emphasized along with the obvious use of new sets of vocabulary and grammatical structures.

Instruction is through the immersion method; limited English is spoken in the class after the first few weeks. Grammatical structure is taught orally throughout the curriculum, as required by given situations, rather than in a structured series of exercises. The ultimate goal of the study of world language at ESA is to demonstrate that a world language can become a natural means of communication and an integral part of life.

The ideal candidate will engage students in a variety of ways to engender enthusiasm for the lessons, and he/she will embrace the idea of the immersion method. A Bachelor's degree is required, and a Master's degree is preferred. Ideal candidates should have a high degree of fluency in both Spanish and French (at least Advanced on the ACTFL proficiency level or at least B2 on the DELF framework).

Weâ€™ve been in similar situations, combatted mental health conditions ourselves, and worked in psychiatric nursing environments that didnâ€™t value patientsâ€™ voices â€” and we didnâ€™t like how we were treated. So we set a new standard for patient care by being one of the first practices to adopt a telehealth model for interactive, in-home services. Which is why we take a humanistic and positive psychiatry approach to treating a variety of psychiatric disorders and all ages ranging from preschool through adulthood. We support you with short-term treatment plans because we know you donâ€™t want to be on medication forever. We make medication decisions with you, not for you, and we provide alternative treatment options and therapies. We fight the stigma around mental health medication because being in a steady-state is more important than suffering in shame and silence. We donâ€™t just prescribe prescriptions â€” weâ€™re here to combine test results and cutting-edge treatment modalities with creating balance using the basics of self-care and removing barriers to getting support. We work closely with other members of your health care team to form a collaborative approach to your treatment.
